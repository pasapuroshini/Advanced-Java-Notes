# Servlet Config and Servlet Context

ServletConfig and ServletContext, both are objects created at the time of servlet initialization and used to provide some initial parameters or configuration information to the servlet.

***But, the difference lies in the fact that information shared by ServletConfig is for a specific servlet, while information shared by ServletContext is available for all servlets in the web application.***
