# Jakarta Server Pages

In Java, **JSP** stands for **Jakarta Server Pages(** (**JSP**; formerly **JavaServer Pages**)**)**. It is a server-side technology that is used for creating web applications. It is used to create dynamic web content. JSP consists of both HTML tags and JSP tags. In this, JSP tags are used to insert JAVA code into HTML pages. It is an advanced version of **Servlet** Technology i.e. a web-based technology that helps us to create dynamic and platform-independent web pages. In this, Java code can be inserted in HTML/ XML pages or both. JSP is first converted into a servlet by the JSP container before processing the client’s request. JSP has various features like JSP Expressions, JSP tags, JSP Expression Language, etc.

**How is JSP more Advantageous than Servlet?**
----------------------------------------------

*   They are easy to maintain.
    
*   No recompilation or redeployment is required.
    
*   Less coding is required in JSP.
    
*   JSP has access to the entire API of JAVA.
    
*   JSP are extended version of Servlet.

Creating a simple JSP Page
--------------------------

**hello.JSP :**

JSP simply puts Java inside HTML pages. You can take any existing HTML page and change its extension to “.jsp” instead of “.html”. In fact, this is the perfect exercise for your first JSP.

Take the HTML file you used in the previous exercise. change its extension from “.html” to  “jsp”. Now load the new file, with the “.jsp” extension, in your browser.

You will see the same output, but it will take longer! But only the first time. If you reload it again, it will load normally.

What is happening behind the scenes is that your JSP is being turned into a Java file, compiled, and loaded. This compilation only happens once, so after the first load, the file doesn’t take long to load anymore. (But every time  you change the JSP file, it will be re-compiled again.)

Of course, it is not very useful to just write HTML pages with a .jsp extension! We now proceed to see what makes JSP so useful.

### **Explain JSP Elements:**

We will learn about the various elements available in JSP with suitable examples. In JSP elements can be divided into 4 different types.

These are:

*       Expression
    
*       Scriplets
    
*       Directives
    
*       Declarations
    

### Expression:

We can use this tag to output any data on the generated page. These data are automatically converted to string and printed on the output stream.

**Syntax:**
JSP Expressions are :` <%="Anything" %>`


***NOTE : JSP Expressions start with Syntax of JSP Scriptles are with <%=and ends with %>.  Between these, you can put anything that will convert to the String and that will be displayed.***

### **Scriplets:**

In this tag we can insert any amount of valid java code and these codes are placed in the \_jsp Service method by the JSP engine.

**Syntax:**
`<%//java codes%>`


***NOTE : JSP Scriptlets begins with <% and ends %> . We can embed any amount of Java code in the JSP Scriptlets. JSP Engine places these codes in the _jspService() method.***


**Variables available to the JSP Scriptlets are:**

*    Request
    
*    Response
    
*    Session
    
*    Out


### **Directives:**

A JSP “directive” starts with <%@ characters. In the directives, we can import  packages , and define error-handling pages or the session information of the JSP page.

**Syntax:**
`<%@directive attribute="value"% > `


*    page
    
*    include
    
*    taglib


### **Declarations :**

This tag is used for defining the functions and variables to be used in the JSP.

**Syntax:**
`<%!
  //java codes
%>`

****NOTE : JSP Declaratives begins with <%! and ends %> with We can embed any amount of java code in the JSP Declaratives. Variables and functions defined in the declaratives are class-level and can be used anywhere on the JSP page.****


```
<%@page import="java.util.*"%>
<HTML>
<BODY>
<%!
Date theDate = new Date(); // Corrected the unwanted space in the declaration
Date getDate() {
    System.out.println("In getDate() method");
    return theDate;
}
%>

Hello! The time is now <%=getDate()%>
</BODY>
</HTML>
```
 ## Example of a JSP Web Page:
 ```
 <HTML>
 <HEAD>
 <TITLE>A Web Page</TITLE>
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
 <%out.println("Hello there!");%>
 </BODY>
 </HTML>

```

Run a Simple JSP Page:
----------------------

*   **Step 1:** Save the JSP file using “.jsp” extension (ex- “hello.jsp”)
    
*   **Step 2:** Start the server
    
*   **Step 3:** Place your application inside a folder
    
*   **Step 4:** To execute the JSP script, simply start tomcat server and use a browser to browse an URL of the JSP page i.e. http://localhost:portnumber/YourApplicationContextRoot/jspfile then you will see the jsp file is being compiled.
